I'm only left with 5 days
Four hours every day. In total 20 hours

In the first two days I would like to make it so the website works,
So these are the features that need to be included:
You should:
Be able to see different sliders on the home based on the property of the shoes (nuovi arrivi , best seller)
Be able to look for the shoe in the search bar
Be able to register and login.
Be able to filter the list of shoes that you will be provided with
Be able to chose which shoe you want, size and color
Be able to add shoes to your cart
Be able to purchase a shoe
In your personal dashboard you should be able to see all your orders and their status and also make orders

In the third and fourth day I would like the site to be finished stylistically
So the elements that need particular care in their styling are:
Header
sliders
Footer
cart
shoe
dashboard
filter
login form
register form
payment form

1-
2-
3-
4-
5-

So if i add it to the cart to the localstorage cart...
if the shoe is already present in the array then it shouldn't be added again but the shoe  that is the same to it should have the quantity increased by one

Allright

I'm at a good point right now

So basically when the user is logged in and he adds a shoe to his cart it should make a patch request, to add shoe to the shoes array of cart document
I that shoes is already present than it should increase the quantity of that shoes

Later on on the cart there will also be two other kind of requests:
One for adding/subtrascting quantity (patch)
One for removing the shoe completely (put)

Once that is done then the project will be functionally completed

There is still the part of the dashboard though
you should be able to make orders there 


still have to manage the infinite scrolling thing







Also later on I will have to calculate the price of the things, it shouldn't matter where i get the array of items from, the calculation will work regardless



what the project still lacks to be functionally
search bar
favorites
pagination

now i need to make those requests


So now im in the payment  thing

When i click purchase it should create a order document inside the orders collection
So what does this order contain:
It contains:
userId: This is needed because when I am on the user dashboard this allows me to find his orders
shoes: This contains the shoes that the user had added to his cart
status: This shows the status of the order ("I will leave it at pending")


let's list all the things that I still need to take care of:

Responsiveness for every page
The menu thing that is pure css
The slider that needs to shrink
The shoedetail page which needs to shrink 
The cart page
The Footer

Modal that works also for preferences

Preferences page

Regex for the payment process

How the dashboard looks:
Add the random shoes slider 
Add the favorites slider

Ok one last time let's list all the things that still need to be done:

Things that only need css:
-So the login, register,  components need to be more stilistically pleasing and also the error management
-Footer and header need some responsive adjustments
-cart needs to be more responsive, payment also and also
-Thank you page
-Dashboard also needs to show the random shoes and the favorite shoes

Things that also need some ts:
-Modal for favorites
-Pagination on the products page
-
-

Also need to figure out how to
