I'm only left with 5 days
Four hours every day. In total 20 hours

In the first two days I would like to make it so the website works,
So these are the features that need to be included:
You should:
Be able to see different sliders on the home based on the property of the shoes (nuovi arrivi , best seller)
Be able to look for the shoe in the search bar
Be able to register and login.
Be able to filter the list of shoes that you will be provided with
Be able to chose which shoe you want, size and color
Be able to add shoes to your cart
Be able to purchase a shoe
In your personal dashboard you should be able to see all your orders and their status and also make orders

In the third and fourth day I would like the site to be finished stylistically
So the elements that need particular care in their styling are:
Header
sliders
Footer
cart
shoe
dashboard
filter
login form
register form
payment form

In the fifth day I would like to add some other things like 
lazyloading, children routes, and route guards
